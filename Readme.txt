How to Run:

python3 sha256_cracker.py <target_SHA256_hash>

Replace <target_SHA256_hash> with the actual SHA-256 hash you want to crack.

Requirements:
Ensure the pwntools library is installed:

pip install pwntools

The rockyou.txt file (or any password dictionary) should be present in the same directory or adjust the path accordingly.
This corrected version will help you perform dictionary attacks on SHA-256 hashes using a common password list.
